 git log --graph --decorate
Checkout to directory git checkout feature/signout; git log --graph --decorate
Run git merge story/frogs-and-ox

Check git log now and it should show commit message as Merge branch 'story/frogs-and-ox'

Git merged all the commits we made in the story/frogs-and-ox branch to the master branch. But since we made an additional commit on the master (fixing the typo from LIOON to LION) git created a new merge commit
